# learn-python

This project is a collection of files I have created while learning python.

## Sources

- [The Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

## Log

- 4th March 2023: started following the python tutorial and installed python
  3.11.2. Left off at [Invoking the
  Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#invoking-the-interpreter).

- 5th March 2023: learned how to launch the Python interpreter. On windows, this
  is most easily done by using the `py` command. Also found [a useful link to
  learn more about command line arguments, which can be found
  here](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#command-line-and-environment).
  Left off at [Argument
  passing](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#argument-passing).
